BELLATRIX,NARCISSA,Get Draco.
LUCIUS,BELLATRIX,Why Draco?
BELLATRIX,LUCIUS,"Just sit back and watch, Lucius. Hm? Pour yourself another glass of wine."
BELLATRIX,SCABIOR,Where would you find them?
SCABIOR,BELLATRIX,In the North Forest.
BELLATRIX,SCABIOR,"Lovely scarf, Scabior. Though I am not sure it  your color."
SCABIOR,BELLATRIX,It  not mine.
BELLATRIX,SCABIOR,You Do not say.
BELLATRIX,SCABIOR,"Fancy her, do you, Scabior? Can not say I blame you. MaybeWe will work out a little reward for you, hm? That is, assuming all is as it appears. Ah, Draco. Come here, darling."
BELLATRIX,DRACO,"My friends here saythey have got Harry Potter. Seeing as he  an old school chum of yours, I thought you could confirm the fact for us."
BELLATRIX,DRACO,Well ?
DRACO,BELLATRIX,I Can not  I Can not be sure.
LUCIUS,DRACO,"Look close, Draco. Ifwe are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiven. Do you understand --"
SCABIOR,LUCIUS,"Now, we will not be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy?"
BELLATRIX,SCABIOR,Of course not.
BELLATRIX,NARCISSA,Narcissa. Tend to your husband.
BELLATRIX,DRACO,"Do not be shy, sweetheart. Get up nice and close."
DRACO,BELLATRIX,What  wrong with his face?
BELLATRIX,SCABIOR,"What is wrong with his face, Scabior?"
SCABIOR,BELLATRIX,He came to us that way. I reckon he picked it up in the forest.
BELLATRIX,SCABIOR,Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
BELLATRIX,HERMIONE,"Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand.We will see what the last spell was."
BELLATRIX,HERMIONE,What is that?
BELLATRIX,HERMIONE,Where did you get that!

RON,HARRY,Harry! What are we going to do? We Can not just leave Hermione alone with her!
LUNA,HARRY,Ron? Harry ?
HARRY,LUNA,Luna ?
BELLATRIX,HERMIONE,This sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it?
HERMIONE,BELLATRIX,I Do not know whatyou are talking about.
BELLATRIX,HERMIONE,Liar. What else did you take?
LUNA,HARRY,"You look strange, Harry. Mr. Ollivander, look who  here. It  Harry Potter."
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,"Hello, sir."
BELLATRIX,HERMIONE,I am going to ask you once again: what else did you and your friends take from my vault!
HERMIONE,BELLATRIX,I told you. I Do not know whatyou are talking --
RON,HARRY,"We have to do something, Harry!"
OLLIVANDER,RON,There  no way out. We havetried everything.
LUNA,HARRY,"You are bleeding, Harry."
LUNA,HARRY,That  a curious thing to hide in your sock.
LUNA,HARRY,"You were hiding it, were not you?"
HARRY,MIRROR,Help us.
RON,WORMTAIL,Let her go! Let her go!
WORMTAIL,RON,Shut it! You. Goblin. Come with me.
HARRY,DOBBY,Dobby. What are you doing here?
DOBBY,HARRY,"Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course."
HARRY,DOBBY,Do you mean to say you can Apparate in and out of here? And take us with you?
DOBBY,HARRY,Of course. I am an elf.
RON,HARRY,Works for me.
HARRY,DOBBY,"Right. Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander to --"
RON,DOBBY,Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth.
RON,HARRY,Trust me.
HARRY,LUNA,You will see to Mr. Ollivander?
LUNA,HARRY,Of course.
LUNA,DOBBY,"Wheneveryou are ready, sir."
DOBBY,LUNA,Like her very much.
DOBBY,HARRY,Meet me at the top of the stairs in ten seconds.
DOBBY,HARRY,Who gets his wand?
RON,HARRY,Sss.
BELLATRIX,GRIPHOOK,Well?
GRIPHOOK,BELLATRIX,"I left Gringotts employ many weeks ago, but when I was last in your vault, the sword was there."
BELLATRIX,GRIPHOOK,Perhaps it just walked out on its own then.
GRIPHOOK,BELLATRIX,"There is no place safer than Gringotts, Madam LeStrange."
BELLATRIX,GRIPHOOK,Liar! You Can not deceive me!
BELLATRIX,GRIPHOOK,"Consider yourself lucky, Goblin. The same will not be said for this one."
RON,BELLATRIX,Like hell!
RON,BELLATRIX,Expelliarmus!
HARRY,LUCIUS,Stupefy!
BELLATRIX,HARRY,Stop or she dies!
BELLATRIX,HARRY,Drop your wands.
BELLATRIX,RON,I said drop them!
RON,BELLATRIX,All right!
BELLATRIX,DRACO,"Pick them up, Draco. Now! Well, well, look what we have here. Harry Potter. All bright, shiny and new again. Just in time for the Dark Lord."
BELLATRIX,DRACO,"Call him, Draco."
HARRY,LUCIUS,Stupefy!
BELLATRIX,HARRY,You dirty little monkey! You could have killed me!
DOBBY,BELLATRIX,"Dobby meant only to maim or seriously injure, not kill."
BELLATRIX,NARCISSA,"For God  sake, Cissy, you have got a wand! Use it!"
BELLATRIX,DOBBY,How dare you take a witch  wand. How dare you defy your masters.
DOBBY,BELLATRIX,"Dobby has no master! Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!"
HARRY,BELLATRIX,Give the Dark Lord our regards.
HARRY,HERMIONE,"It  all right, Hermione.you are safe.we are all safe."
HARRY,DOBBY,Dobby  no 
HARRY,DOBBY,"It  okay  Here  Just hold on, Dobby  I will fix you -- Hermione -- your bag -- you must have something -- Essence of Dittany -- something  Hermione! Help me!"
DOBBY,HARRY,Such a beautiful night  to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend  Harry Potter 
BILL,RON,Fleur  seeing to Ollivander. Anyone else need tending --
LUNA,HARRY,We should close his eyes. Do not you think?
LUNA,HARRY,There. Now he could be sleeping.
LUNA,HARRY,Harry. It  all right. That it hurts. That  what reminds us how lucky we are to be alive.
HARRY,LUNA,I want to bury him properly. Without magic.
LUNA,BILL,It  beautiful here.
BILL,LUNA,"It was our Aunt . We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what  left of us, at least."
LUNA,BILL,Muggles think these keep evil away. But they are wrong 
HARRY,BILL,I need to talk to the goblin.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,How are you?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,Alive.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,You probably Do not remember --
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"that I showed you to your vault the first time you visited Gringotts? Even amongst goblins, you are famous, Harry Potter."
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,You buried the elf. I saw you.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,Yes.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,And brought me here.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,You are a very unusual wizard.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,Why did you leave Gringotts?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.
RON,GRIPHOOK,Thenyou are on our side.
GRIPHOOK,RON,This is a wizard  war. I take no side.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"I need to get inside Gringotts, into one of the vaults."
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,It is impossible.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"Alone, yes. With you, no."
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,How did you come by this sword?
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,It  complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,It  complicated.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We did not steal it.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"There is a sword in Madam Lestrange  vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer."
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,And she never suspected?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
RON,GRIPHOOK,Who put it there? The fake.
GRIPHOOK,RON,"It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts."
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,And in Madam Lestrange  vault as well?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,Perhaps.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,I have gold. Lots of it.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,I have no interest in gold.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,Then what?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,That is my price.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,All right.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?"
HERMIONE,HARRY,"Harry, are you thinking there  a Horcrux in Bellatrix  vault?"
HARRY,HERMIONE,"She was terrified when she thought we had been in there. She kept asking you what else we had taken. I had bet anything there  a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it,we are one step closer to killing him."
RON,HARRY,And if we find one? How are we supposed to destroy it if We havegiven Griphook the sword?
HARRY,RON,I am still working on that part.
FLEUR,HARRY,He  too weak.
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,Forgive me if I Do not get up.
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,"Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions."
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"Anything, my boy, anything."
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,"Can you identify these, sir?"
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,And this?
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,Was? Is not it still?
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,You talk about wands likethey have got feelings. Can think.
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore."
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?"
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --"
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,"But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?"
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,I see no reason to put stock in an old wives tale --
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,You are lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There  no guarantee he will find it --"
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,"He has found it, sir."
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,"That  all, sir.We will leave you to get some rest now."
OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"He  after you, Mr. Potter. If it  true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I am afraid you really Do not stand a chance."
HARRY,OLLIVANDER,"Then I guess I will just have to kill him before he finds me, sir."
RON,HERMIONE,You are sure it  hers?
HERMIONE,RON,Positive.
HARRY,HERMIONE,I reckon you should take this then.
HERMIONE,HARRY,Can not I use the other?
RON,HERMIONE,You heard Ollivander. It  Harry  now.
HERMIONE,RON,But I hate that thing -- that  the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel 
HARRY,HERMIONE,"If I can hold it, you can."
RON,HARRY,"How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything."
HARRY,RON,I will know. I Can not explain. It  like they sing to me.
RON,HARRY,That  a bit scary.
HERMIONE,HARRY,"It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --"
HARRY,HERMIONE,No. I just know. When one  near.
FLEUR,HERMIONE,"This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione."
HERMIONE,FLEUR,"It  perfect. Thank you, Fleur."
BILL,HARRY,"You are leaving, are not you."
HARRY,BILL,In the morning.
BILL,HARRY,And Griphook?
HARRY,BILL,He will be leaving too.
BILL,HARRY,"Listen, I Do not know whatyou are up to, but I know goblins. If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you Do not  he will not be forgiving."
LUNA,HARRY,The sky has lost a star.
LUNA,HARRY,My father used to say that when a child died.
LUNA,HARRY,Funny how Mr. Dobby knew exactly where to find us.
HARRY,LUNA,"Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I Do not want you to think I --"
LUNA,HARRY,"I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That  why we Do not need to talk about it."
HARRY,LUNA,Hogwarts?
HARRY,LUNA,"It  not the place you left, you know. It  not the same."
LUNA,HARRY,Neither am I.
RON,HARRY,Always good value. I will miss her.
RON,HARRY,What do you think?
HARRY,RON,Would not know you if I did not know you.
RON,HARRY,You want to tell me what that is?
HARRY,RON,"Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it."
RON,HARRY,You mean he could see you?
HARRY,RON,Something like that. I Do not know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is 
RON,HARRY,Go on.
HARRY,RON,"You will think I am mental, but more than once, when I have looked into it -- I think I have seen Dumbledore."
RON,HARRY,Bloody hell  that  a sight.
HERMIONE,RON,"Well, how do I look?"
RON,HERMIONE,Hideous.
HERMIONE,RON,"Oh dear, I missed a spot, did not I? Hold still "
RON,HERMIONE,"Could not do anything about that bit in the back that  always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --"
RON,HERMIONE,"Never mind. I am good. That is you in there, is not it?"
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?"
WARLOCK,BELLATRIX,Madam Lestrange.
BELLATRIX,WARLOCK,Good morning.
GRIPHOOK,HERMIONE,"Good morning? Good morning?you are Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!"
RON,GRIPHOOK,Hey. Easy.
GRIPHOOK,RON,She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand?
HERMIONE,RON,He  right. I was being stupid.
HARRY,RON,C amon. Let  do it.
GOBLIN,BELLATRIX,Identification.
BELLATRIX,GOBLIN,I hardly think that will be necessary.
GOBLIN,BELLATRIX,Madam Lestrange! Dear me! How may I help you today?
BELLATRIX,GOBLIN,I wish to enter my vault.
GOBLIN,BELLATRIX,"I see. Very well. Excuse me, will not you?"
BELLATRIX,GOBLIN,I Do not like to be kept waiting.
GOBLIN,BELLATRIX,Next.
BELLATRIX,GOBLIN,"He  with me. As difficult as that may be to
imagine."
GRIPHOOK,RON,They know!
RON,GRIPHOOK,What do you mean?
GRIPHOOK,RON,They know she  an imposter!they have been warned!
BOGROD,BELLATRIX,Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand?
BELLATRIX,BOGROD,And why should I do that?
RON,HARRY,"Harry, what do we do? Harry ?"
BOGROD,BELLATRIX,"It  the bank  policy. I am sure you understand, given the current climate --"
BELLATRIX,BOGROD,"No, I most certainly do not understand --"
BOGROD,BELLATRIX,I am afraid I must insist.
HARRY,BOGROD,Imperio.
BOGROD,BELLATRIX,"Very well, Madam Lestrange. If you will follow me."
GOBLIN,BOGROD,"But  Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault."
BOGROD,GOBLIN,I am fully aware of that. I am also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families.
GOBLIN,BOGROD,"Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --"
BOGROD,GOBLIN,"Let me be specific with you, Ricbert. I have run this bank for forty-five years, long before anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood!"
BOGROD,BELLATRIX,"Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself."
BOGROD,GUARD,"Teffington, see to that door, will you."
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,How long before they come after us?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,Time will tell.
RON,HARRY,What  that? Up ahead.
GRIPHOOK,RON,I should have known --
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"What is that, Griphook?"
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,Griphook! What is that!
HARRY,HERMIONE,Well done. Hey. You look like  you.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,The Thief  Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly.
RON,GRIPHOOK,"You Do not say. Just out of interest  is there
any other way out of here?"
GRIPHOOK,RON,No.
BOGROD,GRIPHOOK,What the devil are you all doing down here!
GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,We need him!
BOGROD,GRIPHOOK,"Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you --"
RON,BOGROD,Imperio!
GRIPHOOK,RON,Well done.
RON,HERMIONE,No. It  not possible 
RON,HERMIONE,Bloody hell. That  a Welsh Green.
HERMIONE,RON,It looks like it  been down here forever.
GRIPHOOK,HERMIONE,Go on.
RON,HERMIONE,It  been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
HERMIONE,RON,That  barbaric. I 
GRIPHOOK,HERMIONE,We will only have a few seconds. In other words  they will be no doovers. Understood?
GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,"Ready, Bogrod?"
BOGROD,GRIPHOOK,Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course.
RON,HERMIONE,Blimey 
HERMIONE,RON,Look.
HERMIONE,RON,No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
RON,HARRY,"Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?"
HERMIONE,GRIPHOOK,It  hot!
GRIPHOOK,HERMIONE,They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses! Everything you touch will burn and multiply!
HERMIONE,RON,"Ron, your foot!"
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,We will be crushed! Hurry!
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,That  it. Up there.
HERMIONE,HARRY,How are we going to reach it?
HARRY,HERMIONE,Give me the sword! The real one.
RON,HARRY,Keep going!
HERMIONE,HARRY,Harry! Behind you!
RON,HERMIONE,The cup!
HERMIONE,HARRY,In here! 
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"We have a deal, Griphook. "
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,I said I had get you in.  I never said anything about getting you out. 
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,Griphook!  Griphook!
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,Thieves!  Help!  Thieves! 
RON,GRIPHOOK,Foul little git.  Least We havegot Bogrod
RON,HERMIONE,That  unfortunate.
HERMIONE,RON,We Can not just stand here!  Who  got an idea?
RON,HERMIONE,You are asking us? you are the brilliant one. 
HERMIONE,RON,I have got something.  But it  mad. 
HERMIONE,RON,Relashio!
RON,HERMIONE,That  your idea? 
HARRY,RON,Come on! 
HERMIONE,HARRY,It does not realize it  free! 
HERMIONE,HARRY,Leviosa!  Aviatus!  Ex Cappa!
RON,HERMIONE,That was brilliant!  BRILLIANT!
RON,RON,Bloody hell.
HARRY,RON,We are dropping!
RON,HERMIONE,I say we jump!
HERMIONE,RON,When?
HARRY,HERMIONE,Now!
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,"The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini.  We must find out just how  much he knows.  We must return to  our hiding places and see if the others are safe. "
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,"And you, my friend, must stay close  "
HARRY,HERMIONE,He knows.
HARRY,HERMIONE,You-Know-Who.  He knows we broke into Gringotts.  He knows what we took.  He knowswe are hunting Horcruxes. 
HERMIONE,HARRY,How is it you 
HARRY,HERMIONE,I saw him.
HERMIONE,HARRY,"You let him in!  Harry, you Can not "
HARRY,HERMIONE,"I Can not always help it, Hermione! Maybe I can.  I Do not know. "
RON,HARRY,Never mind!  What did you see? 
HARRY,RON,He  angry.  But he  scared too.  He  going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe. 
RON,HARRY,What happens when he finds out four are gone? 
HARRY,RON,I reckon he will do anything to stop us from finding the rest.  There  more:  one of them  at Hogwarts. 
RON,HARRY,What?
HERMIONE,HARRY,What? You saw it. 
HARRY,HERMIONE,"I saw the castle.  And Rowena  Ravenclaw.  I think it must have  something to do with her.  We have  to go there, now."
HERMIONE,HARRY,Tonight?  But we have to plan.  We have to figure out what 
HARRY,HERMIONE,"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked?  We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose. "
RON,HERMIONE, Afraid he  right.  One problem:  Snape  Headmaster now.  We Can not just walk in the front door. 
HARRY,RON,We will go to Hogsmeade.  To Honeydukes.  Take the secret passage in the cellar.
HARRY,RON,"There  something wrong with him.  In the past, I could always follow his thoughts.  Now everything feels disconnected. "
RON,HARRY,Maybe it  because of the Horcruxes.  Maybe he  growing weaker.  Maybe he  dying. 
HARRY,RON,"No.  It  more like he  wounded.  If anything, he feels more dangerous."
DEATH EATER #1,DEATH EATER #2,There!  Right there! 
DEATH EATER #1,DEATH EATER #2,I have got them!  Down here!!
HERMIONE ,HARRY,They were ready for us.
DEATH EATER #1,HARRY,"We knowyou are here, Potter.  There  no getting away. "
DEATH EATER #1,HARRY,Perhaps you need some convincing
RON,HERMIONE,What  he mean by that? 
HERMIONE,HARRY,"No, you will give us away. "
HARRY,DEATH EATER #1,Expecto Patronum! 
DEATH EATER #2,DEATH EATER #1,It  him!  He  down there! 
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"In here, Potter."
RON,HERMIONE,Did you get a look at him!  For a second I thought it was -
HERMIONE,RON,I know. 
HERMIONE,HARRY,Harry!  I can see you!  In here! 
ABERFORTH,HARRY,You bloody fools!  What were you thinking coming here?  Do you have any idea how dangerous it is -- 
HARRY,ABERFORTH,You are Aberforth. 
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Dumbledore  brother.  It  you I have been seeing -- here.  It  you who sent Dobby. 
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Where have you left him?
HARRY,ABERFORTH,He is dead.
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Sorry to hear it.  I liked that  elf
HARRY,ABERFORTH,How had you come by it? 
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"Mundungus Fletcher, About a year ago."
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Dung had no right selling you that.  It belonged to -
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Sirius.  Albus told me.  He also told me that you had likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it.  But ask yourself where you had be if I did not. 
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"Right then.  Reckonyou are hungry.  Let  get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here."
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,Do you hear much from the others?  From the Order? 
ABERFORTH,HERMIONE,The Order is finished.  You-KnowWho  won.  Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves
HARRY,ABERFORTH,We need to get into Hogwarts.  Dumbledore gave us a job to do
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Did he now?  Nice job?  Easy? 
HARRY,ABERFORTH,We havebeen hunting Horcruxes.  We think the last one  in the school.  ButWe will need your help getting in. 
HARRY,ABERFORTH,"If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all.  We need to get into Hogwarts tonight"
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"It  not a job my brother  given you, it  a suicide mission.  Do yourself a favor boy.  Go home.  Live a little longer. "
HARRY,ABERFORTH,"Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through. "
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"What makes you think you can trust him!  What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you!  In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name?  Did he ever mention hers?"
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Why should he  
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Keep secrets? You tell me.
HARRY,ABERFORTH,I only care about the Dumbledore I knew.  I trusted him. 
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Did you now?  And why is that? 
HARRY,ABERFORTH,I had no reason not to -- 
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"That  a boy  answer.  A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who will not even tell him where to start. you are lying.  Not just to me, which does not matter, but to yourself as well. That  what a fool does."
HARRY,ABERFORTH,You are drunk.
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"You Do not strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter.  So I will ask you again.  There must be a reason.  Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you?  Why? "
HARRY,ABERFORTH,"Because I need to.  Because if I Do not, I Do not know who I am anymore.  I have lost too many people to lie down now.  I am not interested in what happened between you and your brother, I Do not even care that you have given up.  I trust the man I knew.  I am going to see this through. "
HARRY,ABERFORTH,I need to get into the castle tonight
ABERFORTH,HARRY,You know what to do 
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Where have you sent her?
ABERFORTH,HARRY,You will see soon enough. 
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,"That  Ariana, is not it?  Your sister.  She  beautiful"
ABERFORTH,HERMIONE,She will always be beautiful. 
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,"She died very young, did not she? "
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her.  She was devoted to him -- he gave her everything, but time. "
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,Mr. Dumbledore  thank you.
HERMIONE,RON,"Did save our lives twice.  Kept an eye on us in that mirror.  That does not seem like someone who  given up, does it? "
HERMIONE,RON,She  coming back!  And she  got someone with her!
RON,HERMIONE,Who  that with her?  Bloody hell  
NEVILLE,HARRY,I knew you had come!  I told them all!  Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!
HARRY,NEVILLE,"Neville, you look  "
NEVILLE,HARRY,Like hell?  I reckon.  This is nothing.  Seamus is worse.  You will see.  Hermione!  Ron! 
NEVILLE,ABERFORTH,"Hey, Ab.  There might be a couple more people on the way."
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Well, ready?"
RON,NEVILLE,I Do not remember this being on the Marauder  Map. 
NEVILLE,RON,That  because it never existed till now.  The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year.  This is the only way in or out now.  The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors. 
HERMIONE,NEVILLE,"How bad is it, Neville?  With Snape as Headmaster. "
NEVILLE,HERMIONE,Hardly ever see him.  It  the Carrows you have to watch out for.
HARRY,NEVILLE,The Carrows?
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Brother and sister.  They are in charge of discipline.  Like punishment, the Carrows."
HERMIONE,NEVILLE,They did that to you?  But why? 
NEVILLE,HERMIONE,Today  Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse.  On First Years.  I refused.  Hogwarts has changed. 
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Aw, c amon.  Do not be grim. we are all used to it by now.  And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope.  I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.  C amon,we are almost there. "
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,"Hey!  Listen up, you lot!  I have brought you a surprise! "
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,"Not more of Aberforth  cooking, I hope.  Be a surprise if we could digest it. "
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,Blimey.
NEVILLE,NIGEL,Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry  back. 
NIGEL,"RIVER, DA","River, DA calling.  Do you read?  We have a new weather report:  Lightning has struck.  I repeat, lightning has struck  "
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,"Okay, okay!  Stand down!  Let  not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance! "
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Right then.  What  the plan, Harry? "
HARRY,NEVILLE,"Okay.  There  something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle.  It could help us defeat You-Know-Who. "
NEVILLE,HARRY,What is it?
HARRY,NEVILLE,We do not know.
DEAN,HARRY,Where is it?
HARRY,DEAN,do not know that either. 
HARRY,SEAMUS,I realize it is not much to go on.
SEAMUS ,HARRY,That is nothing to go on. 
HARRY,SEAMUS,"I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw.  It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable.  Any ideas? "
LUNA,HARRY,"Well, there  Rowena Ravenclaw   lost diadem. "
RON,LUNA ,"Oh, bloody hell.  Here we go. "
LUNA,RON,The lost diadem of Ravenclaw?  Has not anyone ever heard of it?  It  quite famous. 
CHO,RON,"It  a kind of crown.  You know, like a tiara."
CHO,HARRY,"Ravenclaw  was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer. "
GINNY,HARRY,Harry.
HARRY,GINNY,Hey there. 
RON,HERMIONE,"Six months she has not seen me and it  like I am Frankie First Year.  I mean, I am only her brother. "
SEAMUS,HARRY,"Got loads of those, though, does not she?  There  only one Harry"
RON,SEAMUS,"Shut up, Seamus. "
NEVILLE,GINNY,"What is it, Ginny?"
GINNY,NEVILLE,Snape knows.  He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
ALECTO CARROW,MAISY REYNOLDS ,"Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds.  Would not want me to have to pay a visit to Daddy again, would you?"
SNAPE ,ALECTO CARROW,Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour.  It has come to my attention that earlier this evening  Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade. 
SNAPE ,ALECTO CARROW,I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by rumor. 
SNAPE ,ALECTO CARROW,"For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise.  We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter  return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable.  Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls.  But know this.  Should anyone -- student or staff  -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression.  Rest assured:  So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle. "
SNAPE ,MAISY REYNOLDS ,Now then.  If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter  movements this evening  I invite them to step forward now. 
HARRY,SNAPE,I think I can help you out with that  
HARRY,SNAPE ,"It would seem that, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster. "
HARRY,SNAPE ,And I am afraid it  rather extensive
HARRY,SNAPE,How dare you stand where he stood. 
HARRY,SNAPE,"Tell them how it was that night.  Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you  and killed him.  Tell them! "
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,SNAPE,Coward!  COWARD!  And he did not even stay to fight! 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,HARRY,"Mr. Potter, do you mind telling me whatyou are doing here, which, I trust you realize, is an act of complete and utter lunacy? "
HARRY,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,I am a Gryffindor. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,HARRY,I thought it might have something to do with that. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,HARRY,"It appears that your Headmaster, to use the common phrase, has done a bunk. "
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,I know that many of you will want  to fight.  Some of you may even think this wise.  But this is folly. 
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,I wish you no harm.  I have great respect for the students of Hogwarts.  I was once one myself after all.  I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shall be spilt  
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,Give me Harry Potter.  Do this and none shall be harmed.  Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.  Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded
PANSY PARKINSON,VOLDEMORT,But he  there!  Potter  there!  Someone grab him! 
FILCH,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,Students out of bed!  Students in the corridors! 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,FILCH,"They are supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot! "
FILCH,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,"Oh, sorry mum. "
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,FILCH,"Wait!  As it turns out, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune.  If you would, I had like you to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall. "
FILCH,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,"Right away. Er, exactly where is it I had be leading em to, mum? "
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,FILCH,The dungeons should do.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,HARRY,"I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.  What is it you need? "
HARRY,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,Time.  As much as you can give me. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,HARRY,Do what you have to do. I will secure the castle. 
HARRY,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,"Is that possible, professor? "
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,HARRY,"We teachers are rather good at magic, Potter.  We haveeven been known to turn out a worthwhile witch or wizard on occasion. "
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,HARRY,I think it  time I ask a few of them to take their magic beyond the classroom.  What do you think? 
HARRY,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,I think you are right. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,HARRY,"By the way Potter, it is good to see you. "
HARRY,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,"You, too, professor "
NEVILLE,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,"Let me get this straight, Professor. you are giving us permission to do this? "
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,NEVILLE,"That is correct, Longbottom. "
NEVILLE,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,To blow it up. Boom. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,NEVILLE,Boom.
NEVILLE,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,"Wicked. Um  exactly how do you propose we do this, Professor? "
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,NEVILLE,"Why Do not you confer with Mr. Finnegan. As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics. "
SEAMUS,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,I can bring  her down. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,SEAMUS,That is the spirit. Now you go off. 
FLITWICK,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,"You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely. "
MADAM SPROUT,FLITWICK,That does not mean we can not hold him up. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,FLITWICK,"That does not mean we Can not hold him up.  And his name is Voldemort, Filius.  You might as well use it.  He  going to try to kill you either way."
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,TEACHERS,Hogwarts is threatened!  Man the boundaries and protect us!  Do your duty to our school! 
TEACHERS,PROFESSOR McGONAGALL,Protego Maxima  Finato Duri  Repello Inimicum 
RON,HARRY,"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking.  It does not really matter if we find the Horcrux."
HARRY,RON,What are you saying? 
HERMIONE,RON,Unless we can destroy it. 
RON,HERMIONE,So you were thinking 
HERMIONE,RON,You were thinking.  It  Ron  idea.  And it  brilliant. 
RON,HERMIONE,"You destroyed Tom Riddle  Diary with a Basilisk fang, right?  Well, we know where we might find one, Do not we? "
HARRY,HERMIONE,Okay.  But take this.  That way you can find me when you get back. 
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where are you going? 
HARRY,HERMIONE,Ravenclaw Common Room. Go to start somewhere. 
LUNA,HARRY,Harry!  Wait!  I need to talk to you! 
HARRY,LUNA ,"I am a bit preoccupied right now, Luna. "
LUNA,HARRY,But you will not find anything whereyou are going. you are wasting your time. 
HARRY,LUNA ,"We will talk later, Luna. "
LUNA,HARRY,Harry -- 
HARRY,LUNA ,Later. 
LUNA,HARRY,HARRYPOTTER!  YOU LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW
LUNA,HARRY,Do not you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw  diadem:  There  not a person alive who  seen it. 
HARRY,LUNA ,so? 
LUNA,HARRY,"It  obvious, is not it?  We have to talk to someone who  dead."
LUNA,HARRY,"He is very impressive, is not he. "
VOLDEMORT,THICKNESSE,They never learn.  Such a pity. Begin. 
THICKNESSE,VOLDEMORT,"But my lord, should not we wait "
FRED,GEORGE,Nice night for it!
HARRY,LUNA ,"Okay Luna, who have you got in mind? "
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,That  it.  I want a charge on each and every joist. 
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,"You do know whatyou are doing, Do not you, Seamus? Blimey. Not Good.  "
LUNA,HARRY,"Ifyou are to find her, you will find her down there. "
HARRY,LUNA ,Are not you coming? 
LUNA,HARRY,No.  I think it best if you two talk alone.  She  very shy. 
KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,DEAN,Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
DEAN,KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,"Yes, sir. "
KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,DEAN,"Dean! On second thought, tell Professor McGonagall we might need one or two more wands this side. "
LUPIN,KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,"It  the quality of one  conviction that determines success, not the number of one  followers. "
KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,LUPIN,Who said that?
LUPIN,KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,Me. 
LUPIN,TONKS,Speaking of quality. You should not have.  It  Teddy who needs you. 
TONKS,LUPIN,He will sleep until dawn and snore like his father.  It  you who needs me tonight. 
HARRY,THE GREY LADY ,It is you 
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Yeah!  You and whose army! 
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,Woah! Easy up there!
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Sorry. Ow. 
RON,HERMIONE,Take me inside. Harry talks in his sleep.  Have not you noticed? 
HERMIONE,RON,No.  Of course not.
RON,HERMIONE,I have never gotten this far before. 
HERMIONE,RON,I am scared. 
RON,HERMIONE,Me too. 
HERMIONE,RON,I did not expect it to be like this. 
RON,HERMIONE,What did you expect it to be like? 
HERMIONE,RON,Not this. 
HARRY,THE GREY LADY ,"You are the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower. "
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,I do not answer to that name. 
HARRY,THE GREY LADY ,"I am sorry.  It  Helena, is not it?  Helena Ravenclaw.  Rowena  daughter.  Luna told me. "
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,Are you a friend of Luna is?
HARRY,THE GREY LADY ,Yes.  She thought you might be able to help me. 
THE GREY LADY ,HARRY,You seek my mother is diadem. 
HARRY,THE GREY LADY ,Yes!  That  right -
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,"Luna is kind.  Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong.  I cannot help you. "
HARRY,THE GREY LADY ,"Wait, please!"
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,Many have sought my mother  diadem.  Its powers are legendary  
HARRY,THE GREY LADY ,"But I Do not care about its powers!  Honestly -- I Do not seek it for myself!  You have to believe me! I want to destroy it. That  what you want, is not it, Helena?  You want it destroyed. "
THE GREY LADY ,HARRY,She thought I took it to hurt her. 
THE GREY LADY ,HARRY,It is here. In the castle. In the place where everything is hhidden
THE GREY LADY ,HARRY,"If you have to ask, you will never know. If you know, you need only ask "
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Thank you
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Thank you
RON,HERMIONE,You do it.
RON,HERMIONE,"Yes, you can."
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,EVERYONE,Fall inside! Everybody! Fall inside!

FILCH,PANSY PARKINSON,Night-tee night.
PANSY PARKINSON,FILCHH,"You let us out of here, you filthy squib!"
HARRY,NEVILLE,Ginny! Neville! You alright?
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Hhave not seen Luna, have you?"
HARRY,NEVILLE,Luna--?
NEVILLE,HARRY,"I am mad for her! Think it is about time I told her, seeing as there is a pretty good chhance we will both be dead by dawn?"
GINNY,NEVILLE,I know.
RON,HERMIONE,Bloody hell. We will never find him on this.
HERMIONE,RON,There he is.
RON,HERMIONE,What?
RON,HERMIONE,Brilliant
HERMIONE,RON,He vanished. Just now. I saw it.
RON,HERMIONE,"He must have gone into the room of Requirement. It does not shhow on the map, remember? You said so last year."
HERMIONE,RON,That is right. I did.
RON,HERMIONE,let is go.
HERMIONE,RON,Brilliant 
DRACO,GOYLE,Take my hand. Now. 
DRACO,HARRY,"Well, well, what brings you here, Potter?"
HARRY,DRACO,I could ask you the same.
DRACO,HARRY,I virtually Lived here last year. Remember?
HARRY,DRACO,I remember.
DRACO,HARRY,You have something of mine. I would like it back.
HARRY,DRACO,"It is my mother is. It is very powerful, but it is not the same. It does not  understand me. Know what I mean?"
DRACO,HARRY,Easy.
HARRY,DRACO,Why did not you tell her?
HARRY,DRACO,Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you did not say anything.
DRACO,HARRY,Give me my wand.
HARRY,DRACO,No. I do not think so 
HARRY,DRACO,"Besides, its allegiance is to me now. if you want it, you will have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me "
GOYLE,DRACO,"C amon, Draco. do not be a prat. Just do  him. "
GOYLE,RON,Avada Kedavra!
GOYLE,HARRY,Avada Kedavra!

HARRY,RON,Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
RON,HARRY,"He is joking, right?"
RON, HARRY,"IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I will KILL YOU, HARRY!"
RON,HARRY,Brilliant
VOLDEMORT,VOLDEMORT,Nagini. Come.
RON,HERMIONE,You are bloody well welcome! Prat. 
HARRY,RON,"Ron, you once asked me if I THOUGHT HHE FELT IT -- vOLDEMORT -- WHEN WE DESTORY A hhorcrux, when we destory a piece of his soul. "
HARRY,RON,He does. 
HARRY,RON,It is the snake. Shhe is the last one. The last Horcrux. 
RON,HARRY,Where will he take her?
HERMIONE,RON,Someplace safe. 
HERMIONE,HARRY,Someplace safe. 
HARRY,HERMIONE,No. He will keep her close. 
HARRY,RON,No. He will keep her close. 
RON,HARRY,"Look inside him, Harry. "
RON,HARRY,"Find out where hhe is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we are one step closer to ending thhis. "
VOLDEMORT,LUCIUS MALFOY,Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she is just eaten. 
LUCIUS MALFOY,VOLDEMORT,"Forgive me, my lord, but would not it be more prudent to call off thhis battle and seek the boy yourself?"
VOLDEMORT,LUCIUS MALFOY,"I do not need to seek the boy! Before thhe night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!"
LUCIUS MALFOY,VOLDEMORT,"Of c-course, my Lord. "
VOLDEMORT,LUCIUS MALFOY,"How do you live with yourself, Lucius? Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately. "
HARRY,RON,I know whhere he is. 
HARRY,HERMIONE,I know whhere he is. 
TRELAWNEY,LUNA,"There is more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan. "
LUNA,NEVILLE,Thanks
NEVILLE,LUNA,do not mention it.
HERMIONE,LAVENDER,No!
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,Why does not it work for me?
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone--"
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,No! I am extraorfinary! But the wand resists me!
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,"There is no wand more powerful. Ollovander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I AM SURE. It answers to you and you only. "
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,Does it?
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,My Lord?
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,The wand. Does it truly answer to me?
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"You are a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know. "
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"Where , Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?"
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,"With you, of course, my Lord. "
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed Dumbedore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine. "
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,My Lord--
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"You have been a good and faithful servant, Severis. "
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,But only I can live forever 
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,Kill
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini! Come!
SNAPE,HARRY,Take them 
SNAPE,HARRY,Take them!
SNAPE,HARRY,Please.
HARRY,SNAPE,Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything. 
SNAPE,HARRY,They are the same 
SNAPE,HARRY,You have your mother is eyes 
RON,HARRY,He is gone. The snake too. 
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,"You have fought valiantly  but in vain. I do not wash this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, disposs of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. Harry Potter, I speak now directly to you. On this night you have allowed your friends to die for you rather thhan face my yourself. There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest and confront your fate. Shhould you do so i give my word that no other life will be lost on this nighht. You have one hour. If, at the end of that time, you have not given yourself up, then I shall punish every last man, woman and child whho tries to conceal you from me. "
RON,VOLDEMORT,Never! Do you hear me! Never!
HERMIONE,RON,Where is everyone?
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where is everyone?
YOUNG SNAPE,LILY,Lily 
PETUNIA,LILY,Lily! Come out of there! Now!
PETUNIA,LILY,We are going home. 
YOUNG SNAPE,LILY,She is jealous. Because she is ordinary and you are special. 
LILY,YOUNG SNAPE,That is mean.
YOUNG SNAPE,LILY,It is true. You know so yourself. 
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,No! do not kill me!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,That was not my intention. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Stand uo, Severus. I have not muchh time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,None. I come on my own account. I come with a   request. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Is thois about the Prophhecy?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Yes. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,how much did you relay?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Only what I heard. But now  he thinks it refers to her. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,The prophhecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of Jult--
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Yes! But he thinks it is her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy."
SNAPE ,DUMBLEDORE,I have asked.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schhoolboy crushh?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,She is more than that! She is different! Beautiful. Kind. Hide them all. I beg you. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Anything.
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,you said you would keep her safe!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus. "
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,The boy servives.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,He has her eyes. 
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,do not!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"If you loved Lily Evans, Severus. If you truly loved her. Then your way is clear. "
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,He does not need protection. The Drak lORD HAS GONE--
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,The Dark lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does. 
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,No one can know. Your word. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"My word that I shhall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist. "
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father is. And he seems to relish his fame. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Sometimes we see whhat we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifes. Personally, I find him rather engaging. "
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You see what you want to see.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Perhaps. Oh. Severus. Keep an eye on professor Quirrell, wo not you?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,I was foolish greedy 
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Drink thhe rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,For the time being?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,It will spread.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,How long?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Maybe a year. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Well, this makes matters much more straightforward."
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort is plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,It is not ecpected that he will succeed. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"But should he fail, one would presume the Dark lord will turn to  you. "
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,You must agree. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the ark Lord trust you completely. "
SNAPE ,DUMBLEDORE,You ask too much.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Too much! Nothing I could ask is too much. You know what is at stake! You more than anyone!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vilnerable. 
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Tell him what?
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric is Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort is soul latched itdelf onto thhe only living thing it could find: Harry himself. "
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,There is a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There is a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort is mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,"So when thhe time comes, the boy must die. "
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Yes. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential. 
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You have kept hhim alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You have been raising him like a pig for slaughter. 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"But this is touching, Severus. do not tell me you have grown to care for the boy?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Exoecto Patronim!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Lily. After all thhis time?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Always 
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"The irony of course, Severus, is that--in the end --you and the boy desire the same thing "
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where have you been?
RON,HARRY,"We thought you would gone to the forest, we thought you might be --"
HARRY,RON,I am going there now. 
RON,HARRY,Are you mad! No!
HARRY,RON,It is meant to be. 
RON,HARRY,Rubbish! You ca not just give yourself up to him--
HERMIONE,HARRY,"what is it, Harry? What is it u=you know?"
HARRY,HERMIONE,There is a reason I can hear thhem--the Horcruxes. 
HARRY,HERMIONE,I think I have know for awhhile. I think you have know too. 
HERMIONE,HARRY,I will go with you. I will--
HARRY,HERMIONE,Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it is just him. Then it will be over. 
OLIVER WOOD,GINNY,I will take hime from here.

HARRY,JAMES POTTER,He wo not be able to see you. 
SIRIUS BLACK,HARRY,"No. We are here, you see. "

LILY POTTER ,HARRY,Always 
YAXLEY,VOLDEMORT,"No sign of him, my Lord."
VOLDEMORT,YAXLEY,"I thought he would come. I was,
it seems  Mistaken"
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,You were not.
HAGRID,HARRY,"HARRY! NO! WHAT are YEH DOIng

YAXLEY,HAGRID,Quiet!
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,"Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived.

DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You cannot help.

HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Sir, this, is this  I mean,
forgive me, but you are dead,
are not you, sir?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Oh, yes."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Then  I am dead too?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Ah. That is the question, is not
it? On the whole I think not."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Not?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Not.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"But I did not defend myself. I let
him kill me."
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"And that will, I think, have made
all the difference. I suspect you
now realize that you and Voldemort
have been connected by something
other than fate since that night
in Godric  Hollow all those years
ago, Harry."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"It  true, is not it, sir? A bit
of him lives in me, does not it?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Did. It was just destroyed only
moments ago by none other than
Voldemort himself.
You were the seventh Horcrux,
Harry; the Horcrux he never meant
to make."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"And you knew this? That  why you
were certain I would not die?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Certain? No. Little is certain
in this world, Harry. Call it an
educated guess."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Professor, is that -- ?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Something beyond either of our
help."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Exactly where are we, sir?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?"
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"It looks like King  Cross station
-- only a lot cleaner. And
without the trains."
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"King  Cross! Is that right?
Well, this is, as they say, your
party."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Sir, why did not you just tell me
about the Deathly Hallows?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You will have to forgive me,
Harry. You see  I did not trust
you.
I feared that you would make the
same mistake I made, that you
would be intoxicated by the power
the Hallows promise their
possessor. But I crave your
pardon, Harry. It  clear to me
now, as it should have been all
along, that you are the better
man."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Sir--
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You are the worthy possessor of
the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was
fit to own the Elder Wand, because
I took it not for gain, but to
save others from it. But I took
the Stone because I longed to
recall someone who has long been
at peace and for that I paid with
my life."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"You wanted to see Ariana again,
did not you, sir?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Yes.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"I used the Stone as well, sir,
only a little while ago when I
entered the Forest. I saw my mum
and dad, and Sirius and Lupin "
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"True. But ask yourself this:
were you calling them? Or were
they calling you?
You are the true master of death,
Harry, because the true master
does not seek to run away from
death. He accepts that he must
die, and understands that there
are far, far worse things in the
living world."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"I have got to go back, have not I?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,That is up to you.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,I have got a choice?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Oh yes. We are in King  Cross,
you say? I think, should you so
decide, you would be able to,
let  say, board a train."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And where would it take me?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,On.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Voldemort  got the Elder Wand.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,True.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And the snake lives.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Yes
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And I have nothing to kill it with
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
I have always prized my ability to
turn a phrase -- words are, in my
not so humble opinion, our most
inexhaustible source of magic,
capable both of inflicting injury
and remedying it. But I would --
in this case -- amend my original
statement to this:
Help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who most deserve
it 
Assuming circumstances in the main
are favorable to such an outcome,
of course."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"With all due respect, sir, I think
what we need here is a miracle."
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"I have never put much stock in
miracles, Harry. On the other
hand, I can attest wholly to the
extensive advantages of a related
phenomenon."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Which would be, sir?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Luck.
Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity
the living and, above all, those
who live without love."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Sir, my mother  Patronus. It was
a doe, was not it? Just like
Professor Snape . Curious, Do not
you think?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Actually, if I think about it 
it does not seem curious at all.
(a smile)
I will be going now, Harry"
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Professor.
Is this real? Or has this been
happening inside my head?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Of course it is happening inside
your head, Harry. But why should
that mean that it is not real?"
NARCISSA,HARRY,Is he alive ?
BELLATRIX,VOLDEMORT,"My lord, let me help you --"
VOLDEMORT,BELLATRIX,I do not require assistance.
BELLATRIX,NARCISSA,The boy. Is he dead?
NARCISSA,HARRY,Is he alive? Draco?
NARCISSA,BELLATRIX,Dead
SORTING HAT,NEVILLE,"Do not despair, Longbottom. I put
you in Gryffindor for good
reason "
GINNY,NEVILLE,"Who  that?
  Hagrid  carrying?
Neville, who is that?"
ARTHUR WEASLEY,NEVILLE,"What  going on here, Neville?"
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,"Behold, Nagini. Our work is done."
GINNY,VOLDEMORT,No  NO!
VOLDEMORT,GINNY,"SILENCE!
Stupid girl. You cry for that?"
VOLDEMORT,GINNY,"Tell me. These last few hours --
as you collected the dead and
tended your wounded -- was he by
your side?
While your hands ran dark with the
blood of mothers and sons, fathers
and daughters, brothers and
sisters, his were clasped in
prayer -- but it was a prayer for
one and one only. While you
battled courageously, until you
could no longer will yourself to
stand, he had long since fallen to
his knees. While you cursed me
until your voices grew ragged, he
begged me for mercy in a voice as
meek as a child .
So do not cry for that. He  not
worthy of your tears. And do not
despair of his betrayal. You were
never in his heart. Not for one
single solitary beat."
RON,VOLDEMORT,Liar!
VOLDEMORT,RON,"Did you not hear me! Harry Potter
is dead! From this day forward,
you put your faith in me or suffer
the consequences. HARRYPOTTER IS
DEAD!
Now is the time to declare
yourself."
LUCIUS MALFOY,DRACO,"Draco 
Draco, Do not be stupid --"
NARCISSA,DRACO,"Come, Draco."
RON,DRACO,He saved your life.
VOLDEMORT,DRACO,"Well done, Draco. Who will be
next? Hm? Come now, Do not be
shy."
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Well, I must say, I had hoped for
better. Is this truly the best
Hogwarts has to offer?"
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Who might you be, young man?"
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,Neville Longbottom.
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Well, welcome, Neville. I am sure
we can find a place for you in our
ranks."
BELLATRIX,VOLDEMORT,Someone has to do the washing.
VOLDEMORT,BELLATRIX,"Now, now, Bellatrix. Let  not
underestimate our young friend.
By stepping forward, he lives to
see another day "
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,I had like to say something
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Very well, Neville. I am sure we had
all be fascinated to hear what you
have to say."
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,"It does not matter that Harry is
gone."
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,"Stand down, Neville!"
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,"People die every day. Friends.
Family. Yes, we lost Harry
tonight. But he  still with us,
here --
(tapping his heart)
And so is Fred and Remus and Tonks
and  all of them. They did not
die in vain."
NEVILLE,BELLATRIX,But you will
NEVILLE,DEATH EATERS,And you and you and you will.
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,"And so will you. Becauseyou are
wrong. Harry  heart did beat for
us. All of us 
This is not over."
DRACO,HARRY,Potter!
RON,DRACO,"Well done, Malfoy!

"
RON,RON,Can not believe I just said that.
HARRY,NAGINI,Confringo!
HARRY,FRIENDS,"The snake! We havegot to kill the
snake!"
NEVILLE,HARRY,Harry! Look out!
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini! With me!
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,"Leave her!
I said LEAVE HER!"
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,"Now, my sweet. Now."
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini!
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,"Die! Die!
Why do you live!"
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,"Because I have something worth
living for.
Confringo!"
MRS. WEASLEY,BELLATRIX,"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!"
BELLATRIX,MRS. WEASLEY,"Come on, granny, give us your
best."
MRS. WEASLEY,WEASLEYS,"Back off, boys! She  mine!"
MRS. WEASLEY,BELLATRIX,"You will never touch my children
again!"
BELLATRIX,MRS. WEASLEY,"Be thankful we only took one.
Besides 
It  not like you Do not have a
spare."
RON,HERMIONE,Hermione!
HERMIONE,RON,Yes!
RON,HERMIONE,I need to tell you something!
HERMIONE,RON,"I Do not want you to say anything
you would not say if we were not
about to be killed by a giant
snake! It will just ruin it!"
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,"You were right.
When you told Professor Snape it
was failing you. It will always
fail you."
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,It belongs to me! I killed Snape!
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,"But what if the wand never
belonged to him? What if the
wand  allegiance was to someone
else?
Come on, Tom. Let  end this the
way we started it 
Together."
HERMIONE,RON,What  the matter with her?
TRELAWNEY,SEAMUS,"There  more to me than incense
and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,I told you: it  useless to you.
RON,HERMIONE,"Not exactly leaving the place
better than we found it, are we?"
HERMIONE,RON,"Can not make an omelette without
breaking a few eggs.
Something my mum used to say."
HERMIONE,HARRY,"Why did not it work for him? The
Elder wand."
HARRY,HERMIONE,"Because it answers to another.
When he killed Snape, he thought
the wand would become his. But
the thing is  it never belonged
to Snape.
It was Draco who disarmed
Dumbledore that night on the
Astronomy Tower. From that moment
on, the wand answered to him.
Until the other night 
  when I disarmed Draco."
RON,HARRY,But that means 
HARRY,RON,It answers to me.
RON,HARRY,"What do you reckon we should do
with it?"
HERMIONE,RON,We?
RON,HERMIONE,"I am just saying. That  the Elder
Wand! It  the most powerful
bloody wand in the world! With
that, we could, we could --"
HARRY,RON,"Well, it was not boring, was it?"
HARRY,ALBUS,Together?
HERMIONE,ROSE,"Do not forget to give Professor
Longbottom our best."
ALBUS,HARRY,"Will there really be thestrals
pulling the carriages?"
HARRY,ALBUS,"There  nothing scary about
thestrals. They are gentle things.
Anyway, you will not be going up to
school in the carriages. You will
be going in the boats, remember?"
ALBUS,HARRY,Dad?
HARRY,ALBUS,Yes?
ALBUS,HARRY,What if I am put in Slytherin?
HARRY,ALBUS,"Albus Severus Potter. You were
named after two Headmasters of
Hogwarts. One of them was a
Slytherin. And he was probably
the bravest man I ever knew."
ALBUS,HARRY,But just say I am --
HARRY,ALBUS,"Then Slytherin House will have
gained a wonderful wizard. But
listen, if it means so much to
you, you can choose Gryffindor.
The Sorting Hat takes your choice
into account."
ALBUS,HARRY,Really?
HARRY,ALBUS,"Really.
Ready?"
ALBUS,HARRY,Ready.
